This ENVI formatted file includes a header with the metadata. The data was acquired by AVIRIS-3, an airborne imaging spectrometer, over Sedgwick Reserve (where we did our field trip). Students will be using AVIRIS-3 L2A surface reflectance data to work with the spectra, such as through PCA and spectral mixture analysis to explore sub-pixel fractional cover of different materials.
